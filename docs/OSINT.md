  When it comes to APIs, Kiterunnerâ€™s search techniques outperform other content discovery tools such as dirbuster, dirb, Gobuster, and dirsearch because this tool was built with API awareness. Its wordlists, request methods, parameters, headers, and path structures are all focused on finding API endpoints and resources. Of note, the tool includes data from 67,500 Swagger files. Kiterunner has also been designed to detect the signature of different APIs, including Django, Express, FastAPI, Flask, Nginx, Spring, and Tomcat (just to name a few).
  Currently, Assetnote releases its wordlists, which contain search terms collected from its internet-wide scans, on a monthly basis. All of the wordlists are hosted at https://wordlists.assetnote.io.
