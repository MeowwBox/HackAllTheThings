# Hack All The Things
***
## Isn't this just a nerfed HackTricks?
This is my attempt at sharing everything I know with the infosec community to the best of my ability, and the reference I use when searching for things or recommending people things I came across before. You see I am very forgetful. I hope it can help you as it does help me. 

I don't think of myself just as a security person. I am a learner. You will find notes on writing, scoping, softskills, developlemnt and networking solutions. In addition, to the good old security notes.

## Online book  
The mark down book of this repo has search functionality, collapsing nav bars and some other good stuff ðŸš¶ðŸš¶.
