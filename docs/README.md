# Hack All The Things
***
## Isn't this just a nerfed HackTricks?
You are absolutely correct. However, some topics are not touched upon on [HackTricks](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/) as extensively as this repo. This repo is primarily techniques I use on the daily. Some notes are really lacking. but, some notes are really extensive and include non-conventional ways of doing things. 

### Some notes I am proud of:
- Tailscale Explained
- Tunneling & Pivoting
- Development & Server Management
- Technical Writing
- Desktop Application Security notes
- Source Code Review notes
- All notes under the Misc. Category
- My Testing Setup: Android, WSL and more

Dare I say these are Karim flavored techniques

## Online book
