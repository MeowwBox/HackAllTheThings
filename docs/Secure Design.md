## Key Concepts
### Network Segregation and Segmentation
While network segregation isolates crucial networks from external networks such as the internet, network segmentation splits a larger network in to smaller segments — also called subnets — usually through switches and routers. [^1]

If you have a [flat network](https://insights.sei.cmu.edu/blog/network-segmentation-concepts-and-practices/) (an architecture where all systems connect without going through intermediary devices such as a bridge or router), it is relatively easy for a bad actor to gain access to the entire system through one access point. While flat networks provide fast and reliable connectivity, this lateral access between systems makes them especially vulnerable within today’s modern and complex interconnected organizations.
